{"name":"Fast algorithms for l-adic towers over finite fields","tagline":"research paper presented at ISSAC 2013","body":">  Inspired by previous work of Shoup, Lenstra-De Smit and\r\n>  Couveignes-Lercier, we give fast algorithms to compute in (the first\r\n>  levels of) the $\\ell$-adic closure of a finite field. In many cases,\r\n>  our algorithms have quasi-linear complexity.\r\n\r\nThis paper will be presented at the [International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation 2013](http://www.issac-conference.org/2013/) in Boston.\r\n\r\nA preprint version is available at <http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6021>.\r\n\r\nThe [GitHub sources](http://github.com/defeo/towers) contain the [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) source code as well as the [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/) scripts demonstrating the concepts involved.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
