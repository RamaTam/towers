======

**Authors:** [Luca De Feo](http://defeo.github.io), Javad Doliskani and [Éric Schost](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~eschost/)

>  Inspired by previous work of Shoup, Lenstra-De Smit and
>  Couveignes-Lercier, we give fast algorithms to compute in (the first
>  levels of) the &#8467;-adic closure of a finite field. In many cases,
>  our algorithms have quasi-linear complexity.
